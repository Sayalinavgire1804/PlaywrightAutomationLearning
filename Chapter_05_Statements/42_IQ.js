let x=10;
if(x>5)
    console.log("x is greater than 5");
    console.log("x is greater than 5"); //this will print "x is greater than 5" to the console because the if statement checks if x is greater than 5, which is true since x is 10. Therefore, the code inside the if block is executed, and both console.log statements are executed, printing "x is greater than 5" twice to the console.
