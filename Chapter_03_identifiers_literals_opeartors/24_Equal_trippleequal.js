console.log(5=='5');//this will print true to the console because when using the loose equality operator (==), JavaScript performs type coercion and considers the number 5 and the string '5' to be equal.;    
console.log(5==='5');//this will print false to the console because when using the strict equality operator (===), JavaScript does not perform type coercion and considers the number 5 and the string '5' to be different types and values, resulting in false.
console.log(null===undefined);//this will print false to the console because null and undefined are different types and values in JavaScript. null represents the intentional absence of any object value, while undefined represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
console.log(null==undefined);//this will print true to the console because when using the loose equality operator (==), JavaScript performs type coercion and considers null and undefined to be equal.
console.log(5==5.0);//this will print true to the console because when using the loose equality operator (==), JavaScript considers the number 5 and the number 5.0 to be equal, as they represent the same numeric value.
console.log(5===5.0);//this will print true to the console because when using the strict equality operator (===), JavaScript considers the number 5 and the number 5.0 to be of the same type (number) and value, resulting in true.
console.log(5===5.01);//this will print false to the console because when using the strict equality operator (===), JavaScript considers the number 5 and the number 5.01 to be of the same type (number) but different values, resulting in false.
